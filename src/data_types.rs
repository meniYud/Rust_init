Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. 

The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
In cases when many types are possible, we must add a type annotation.

In this lesson, we will cover the basic data types in Rust.

We will talk about:
- Scalar types
- Compound types
- Custom types
