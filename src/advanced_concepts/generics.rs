By the end of this video, you will understand the fundamentals of Generics, Traits, and Lifetimes in Rust.
We'll start with an introduction to these concepts and their goals. 

Then, we'll dive into Generics in Rust with practical examples then explore Traits and their usage. 

You'll also learn about Lifetimes in Rust and why Generics are essential.
We will cover another example program using Generics to swap values. Finally, we summarize the key points.
